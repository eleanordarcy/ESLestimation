# ESLestimation🌊

## Welcome to our R package for estimating extreme sea levels (ESLs)!

This code uses the methodology of [D’Arcy, E., Tawn, J.A., Joly, A. and Sifnioti, D.E., 2023. Accounting for seasonality in extreme sea-level estimation. The Annals of Applied Statistics, 17(4), pp.3500-3525](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-applied-statistics/volume-17/issue-4/Accounting-for-seasonality-in-extreme-sea-level-estimation/10.1214/23-AOAS1773.full) for estimating extreme sea levels in R. This approach accounts for seasonality, longer-term trends, skew surge-peak tide dependence and skew surge temporal dependence using ideas that extend from extreme value statistics.

There are 5 functions of interest to the user, each with detailed documentation on how to use. A dataset is provided for illustrative purposes.

To install and load the package, please use the following commands
> `library(devtools)`
> 
> `install_github('eleanordarcy/ESLestimation')`
